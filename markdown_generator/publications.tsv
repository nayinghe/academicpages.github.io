A reliable quantitative measure of iron deposition is a potential biomarker for PD and may contribute to the investigation of iron-mediated PD."	"He N, Ling H, Ding B, et al. Region_specific disturbed iron distribution in early idiopathic Parkinson's disease measured by quantitative susceptibility mapping[J]. Human brain mapping, 2015, 36(11): 4407-4420."	paper-region-specific-iron	http://academicpages.github.io/files/paper1.pdf2017-06-30	Dentate nucleus iron deposition is a potential biomarker for tremor_dominant Parkinson's disease	NMR in Biomedicine	"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a heterogeneous neurodegenerative disorder with variable clinicopathologic phenotypes and underlying neuropathologic mechanisms. Each clinical phenotype has a unique set of motor symptoms. Tremor is the most frequent initial motor symptom of PD and is the most difficult symptom to treat. The dentate nucleus (DN) is a deep iron-rich nucleus in the cerebellum and may be involved in PD tremor."	"He N, Huang P, Ling H, et al. Dentate nucleus iron deposition is a potential biomarker for tremor_dominant Parkinson's disease[J].
